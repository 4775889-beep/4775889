# Runnable Code Prompt

Write a complete Python script that:

1. Defines a function to check if a number is prime
2. Finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100
3. Prints them in a formatted way

Requirements:
- Include a `is_prime(n)` function
- Include a `main()` function that finds and prints primes
- Use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern
- Print results in a nice format (e.g., "Prime numbers from 1 to 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, ...")
- The script should be directly executable

Make sure the code runs without errors when executed with `python3 script.py`
